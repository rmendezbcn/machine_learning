Project to classify well performed exercise activities

Classificating exercises using data from portable devices
The goal of this project is to predict what exercise the volunteers are performing based on the data recorded by portable devices such as the reading of gyroscopes and accelerometers.

The objective of the experiment was to assess how well a group of 6 volunteers performed a weight lifting exercise.</p>
The 6 six male participants, aged between 20-28 years, selected for the study were asked to perform the same weight lifting exercise in 5 different manners:
  - Exactly according to the specification (Class A)
  - Throwing the elbows to the front (Class B)
  - Lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C)
  - lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D)
 - throwing the hips to the front (Class E)

The goal of this learning machine learning project is to classify the activity based on the data produced in this study.

The erst of the information is in the rhtml file.
