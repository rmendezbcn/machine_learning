## Classificating exercises using data from portable devices

The goal of this project is to predict what exercise the volunteers are performing based on the data recorded by portable devices such as the reading of <b>gyroscopes</b> and <b>accelerometers</b>.
<p>The objective of the experiment was to assess how well a group of 6 volunteers performed a weight lifting exercise.</p>
<p>The 6 six male participants, aged between 20-28 years, selected for the study were asked to perform the same weight lifting exercise in 5 different manners:</p>
  <li>Exactly according to the specification (Class A)</li> 
  <li>Throwing the elbows to the front (Class B)</li>
  <li>Lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C)</li>
  <li>lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D)</li>
  <li>throwing the hips to the front (Class E)</li>

<p>The goal of this learning machine learning project is to classify the activity based on the data produced in this study.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<h3>Placement of the sensors</h3>
<p>The sensors were placed on all the volunteers according to the schema shown below.</p>

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(png)
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figure/on-body-sensing-schema.png")
```

<h3>Variable selections</h3>
<p>The majority of the variables in the training data set consisted of calculated variables, and only few corresponded to the data produced by the sensors in the mobile devices.</p>
<p>Only the variables containing raw data from the sensors were selected for this project. The selection was done using the grep function on the name of the variables<p>
``` {r eval= FALSE}
var_names <- names(intrain)
selected_vars <- var_names[grep('^accel|^gyros|^magnet|^roll|^pitch|^yaw|^classe', var_names)]
train_set <- subset(intrain, select = selected_vars)
```
<h3>Cross validation</h3>
<p>The cross validation was performed applying the k-fold method: 10 times and 5 repetitions. </p>

<h3>Model building</h3
<p>A random forest was the model selected for the project. </p>
``` {r eval = FALSE}
control <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", repeats = 5)
rfmodfit <- train(classe ~., data = train_set, method = "rpart", trControl = control)
```

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The class A (correct way of performing the exercise) was the main class in the resulting classification tree, and the "deviations" 
from this class show up when different cutoff values were applied to the data. Thus, class A and class E (throwing the hips to the front) were split with the data from the belt; 
the class B (throwing the elbows to the front) was identified using the “y” direction of the magnet dumbbell; and finally the class C (lifting the dumbbell only halfway) was split from the class A 
whit sensor in the forearm. The resulting classification tree is shown in the following Figure.</p>
``` {r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "/machine_learning/class_tree_project.png")
```

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The resulting classification tree seems to be coherent with the idea that the exercises in classes B to E are deviations from the pattern observed in the class A, i.et. when performing the exercise in the correct way.
